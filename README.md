This project is a library that will convert a declarative HQMF measure description into executable JavaScript suitable for use within the hQuery Gateway.


Project Practices
=================

Please try to follow our [Coding Style Guides](http://github.com/eedrummer/styleguide). Additionally, we will be using git in a pattern similar to [Vincent Driessen's workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). While feature branches are encouraged, they are not required to work on the project.
